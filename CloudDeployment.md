# Image Recognition Web Service Deployment - README

This document outlines my approach to deploying the Image Recognition Web Service, a FastAPI-based application for image recognition using the YOLOv8 model. Based on my past experience, I will address the following questions:

1. What infrastructure would I build/setup for this application?
2. How would I approach deploying the application at scale?
3. How could I approach autoscaling?
4. How could I improve storage of the model weights?
5. What third-party solutions could I use for ML deployments?

## 1. Infrastructure Setup

I will use AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) as the foundation for deploying the IR Web Service:

- Provision the EKS Cluster: I will use Terraform to create the EKS cluster, ensuring it is configured with best practices for networking, security, and scalability. This includes setting up a VPC with private and public subnets, enabling VPC endpoints for secure access to AWS services, and configuring IAM roles for service accounts to grant pods secure access to resources like S3 (if required).

- Monitoring and Logging: I will deploy Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application and cluster metrics. For logging, I will use Fluent Bit to forward logs to ElasticSearch or Grafana Loki.

- Security: I will implement AWS WAF and Security Groups to protect the application from external threats.

## 2. Deploying the Application at Scale

To deploy the application at scale, I will do the following:

- Containerization: I will build a minimal Docker image for the application using multi-stage builds to reduce image size and improve security. The image will be pushed to Amazon ECR for secure and scalable storage.

- Deployments: I will use Helm or Kustomize to manage the Kubernetes deployments.

- CI/CD Pipeline: I will set up a Jenkins Pipeline, GitHub Actions or GitLab CI pipeline to automate the build and deployment process. The pipeline will:
  1. Build the Docker image.
  2. Push the image to ECR.
  3. Deploy the application to EKS using either Helm or Kustomize.
  4. Include automated testing and security scans to ensure code quality and security.

- Blue-Green Deployments: I will use Argo Rollouts or Flagger to implement blue-green deployments.

## 3. Autoscaling Approach

To handle varying workloads, I will implement autoscaling at both the pod and cluster levels:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): I will configure HPA to scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization or custom metrics like request latency. If needed, I will use Prometheus Adapter to expose custom metrics to HPA.

- Cluster Autoscaler: I will enable Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust the size of the EKS node group based on pod scheduling demands. I will configure node groups with mixed instance types to optimize cost and performance.

## 4. Improving Storage of Model Weights

To improve the storage of model weights, I will:

- Use S3 for Model Weights: I will store the model weights in Amazon S3 with versioning enabled.

## 5. Third-Party Solutions for ML Deployments

To enhance the ML deployment process, I will leverage the following third-party solutions:

- Managed ML Platforms: I will use AWS SageMaker for end-to-end ML lifecycle management, including training, deployment, and monitoring.
